# vma_recall_fMRI

This code runs the recall version of the visuomotor association (VMA) task for functional MRI. The 
code requires the input from a high-speed (60+ Hz) webcam (preferably in the MRI suite) that tracks a 
user's kinematics by detecting the intensity of an IR light reflected off of a reflective marker.
